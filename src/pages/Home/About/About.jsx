              Hi, I'm Tariqul â€” a passionate junior web developer eager to build
              user-friendly projects that solve real-world problems. My deep
              curiosity about technology led me into this field, and I'm now
              pursuing a Diploma in Computer Science and Technology at
              Kishoreganj Polytechnic Institute to strengthen my skills and
              knowledge.

            <p className="transform transition-all duration-500 hover:translate-x-2">
              I love learning new tools, exploring fresh ideas, and keeping up
              with the latest trends in web development. Beyond coding, I
              actively lead Progress-21, a friendship community that connects
              people and supports social welfare.
            </p>
            <p className="transform transition-all duration-500 hover:translate-x-2">
              During school, I served as Chief of the Student Cabinet, where I
              motivated and guided my peers. I always strive to be responsible,
              punctual, and supportive of my community.
            </p>
