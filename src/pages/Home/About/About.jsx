            Hi, I'm Tariqul â€” a passionate Jr. web developer focused on building user-friendly projects that solve real-world problems. I came into this tech industry with my deep curiosity for technology and how it works. I am currently pursuing my Diploma in Computer Science and Technology at Kishoreganj Polytechnic Institute, where I am building a solid foundation in computer science. I love learning new tools, exploring ideas, and keeping up with the latest trends.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Beyond coding, I actively take on lead roles to grow personally and support my community. I am the Chief Coordinator of Progress-21, a friendship community that brings friends together and contributes to social welfare. During my school years, I was elected as the Chief of the Student Cabinet, where I led and inspired my fellow students. I always strive to be punctual.
          </p>
          <h3 className="font-semibold mb-1">What Drives Me?</h3>
          <p>Passion, curiosity, and initiative fuel me to learn, grow, and make an impact.</p>
